# quotes

"This is 90% of the issue, as long as you expose properly and get your subject in focus, your photos will always turn out

"^That, plus knowing how far you can push a poorly exposed image is also very valuable when pressed for time"

"@hurb I used to shoot in JPEG and hated it because if I didn't like a photo and tried to edit it, it felt useless. When I started shooting RAW I found that photos were a lot more forgiving in post. I've taken photos that we nearly all black, cranked up the exposure, and there's still a ton of data."

"Learn about the exposure triangle and how to read a histogram, itâ€™ll get you further along the curve"

"Oh then absolutely, just shoot as much as you can and paid it with every tutorial you can think of. You can watch Annie Liebowitz master class online for free too (with a few minutes of googling of course) loads out there to help you out and about"

"Lots of distracting objects, no leading lines, focus is on the tree, you could have probably gotten away with a shallower dof, also a slower shutter speed would give it a nice effect of motion, a still tram is rather boring. But thats just me"

"Looks like exponential glow and light wrap  if this is video"

"Also good filtration on your lens will help. Black Pro Mist or Hollywood BlackMagic are both great for achieving shots like that."

"Inconvenient but not a big deal. My first camera a Canon rebel t3 didn't either. I'd just suggest keeping a mental image of the grid in your head and just picturing it over what you see. Those videos i sent there's many in the playlist regarding composition it'll come easier to you as you improve your understanding
Nice gear is nice but i personally would not be satisfied with taking pretty photos with nice clarity to them. I know many Photographers with $10k cameras and thousands in lenses who are not that great. Just do your best to understand all your gear as deeply as possible and what is and is not possible with what you have. (But with a 24mm-104mm or whatever your kit lens is you can do lots)"
