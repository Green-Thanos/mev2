So i was asking arson, but maybe I could get more opinions / advice by asking here. Programming wise, I feel like I've hit a wall and I've realized its really difficult to build something completely on my own. I don't know how to get a starting point on different types of projects to continue off of. One idea I got was to look at the project based learning repo on github and follow one of those, maybe restart after. I was hoping after that I would have picked up enough to start new ideas but I'm not so sure. Any advice for learning how to build my own projects would be appreciated.

following one is a terrible idea imo
what you're supposed to do is, well, programming
and what is programming?
it's breaking down a problem into smaller steps
repeatedly
until you have one that you can do
and doing that single step
you can do the same for project based learning repos though
but tldr the important thing is not doing the project
it's understanding the components of the project
which ones will you always need, which ones are optional, what each part does, which ones you can/should reuse for <your idea>

also just understanding whatever framework in general
because some frameworks are quite painful to get a good understanding of

I think I've made some steps back in the right direction
I've been working on making a working blog on a personal website, and so far made the whole thing myself
I think looking at certain projects can probably be overwhelming to me, since there are a ton of components
for example like a network stack or physics engine or something, i wouldn't know how to start building something like that

just build the very minimum
for network stack: build one part of it first
say, tcp
idk
for physics engine:
well gravity isn't too hard
collisions... you'd need to wikipedia that shit
and ideally you should just use circles and implement a few collision detection algorithms to understand them
softbody/rigidbody physics... you practically need a degree for that (it's a bit of an exaggeration but like, at some point NIH stops being practical. this is roughly that point)
